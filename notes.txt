vim: colorcolumn=80

ok so halfway through figuring this out i've realized that making notes about
how i struggled to get this working probably could help someone


	GETTING THE INIT PROCESS TO WORK
1. the kernel doesn't detect the init process when it's in e.g. /bin/init
that's probably an issue with the way i'm creating the initramfs? ig
easy workaround: just put the executable in /init

2. Failed to execute /init (error -2)
this one is confusing - i tried looking up the error code in
	https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/uapi/asm-generic/errno.h
	https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/uapi/asm-generic/errno-base.h
but i couldn't find -2
i was trying a bunch of random stuff to try and fix that, until i've found
https://bootlin.com/blog/debugging-init-failures/
apparently the minus doesn't really mean anything, and the error is just ENOENT

uhh i tried downloading busybox and putting it there to see if that works, and
it did. then i tried compiling my init again and it worked. issue solved?
